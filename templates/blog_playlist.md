*(Instructions: Modify the title and date in the section above.)*

### Summary
*(Instructions: Briefly describe what the playlist represents, what it includes, etc.)*

Playlist author: <your name / screen name>

*(Instructions: Add a list entry for each item in the playlist. Include artist, title and link. A short comment or 1 -2 sentences is helpful, but optional.)*

- **artist**: [title](url)
<optional: comment - 1 or 2 sentences about the performance or recording.>

- **artist**: [title](url)
<optional: comment - 1 or 2 sentences about the performance or recording.>

etc.

Examples:

- **Yaxu**: [gabba improv - Algorave 10th Birthday Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkZl2uVO4S0&t=85s)
This is one of my favorite Yaxu performances. It is fun, builds intensity and shows how to exploit just a few samples - gabba + cpu. He also live codes a small dancing robot. Cool!

- **Eloi el Bon Noi**: [i la sessió maleïda (The cursed session)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKmHFpXU63k)
Eloi (the good guy) performed this on the Solstice Stream (Dec, 2022) and it burned up the chat with raves. It starts with a radical remix/cutup of the Led Zepplin classic, Kashmir.

*(Instructions: You can also use table format - but you can't add empty lines, it breaks the table. Tables are a better layout visually, but in md format, a long table can be more difficult to edit. Bullet lists are easy.)*

Example .md table format

| Artist  |  recording / performance |
| :--------:    | :---------- |
| Yaxu | gabba improv - [Algorave 10th Birthday Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkZl2uVO4S0&t=85s) |
