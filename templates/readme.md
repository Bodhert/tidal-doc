Templates are created only in the "templates" branch.
Initially these are for use with the Tidal Cycles blog pages, but they can be for any purpose where maintaining a template markdown file is useful.

These should stay on this branch and not be merged.

Template files:

- blog_tidal_profile.md: Tidal Profile in question / response format.
- blog_topic.md: Post on a specific topic. For example - Tidal features, live coding practice, Tidal with external apps, etc. It can also be a more free-form approach to the Blog profile - where you discuss your individual approach to Tidal and livecoding - without following the question/answer format.
- blog_tidal_music.md: Intended for coverage of music made with Tidal. Examples: new music release, review of a Tidal music project, etc.
- blog_playlist.md
